# Server-side Billing

The server is currently handling billing with the Stripe module

## Using Stripe

*API reference*: https://stripe.com/docs/api/node

When requiring the stripe module you need to pass your stripe account secret to the return value from the require statement *const stripe = require('stripe')(secretKey)*. This will provide access to the Stripe API.

### Charges

To charge a debit or a credit card, you create a charge object. You can retrieve or refund individual charges by a unique charge ID. This ID is generated by the client and sent to the server.

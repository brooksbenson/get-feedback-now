# Mongo

## Collection

A collection is an array of records.

## Records

A record is a discrete chunk of data within a collection. Because Mongo is schema-less, records in a collection don't have to all contain the same properties.

## mLab

mLab is a 3rd party database hosting service. It allows us to create and manage databases through a web-based interface.

Once a database has been created on mLab, it will disclose its URI, allowing us to connect to via our server program.

## Mongoose

Mongoose is module that wraps the native Mongo driver, providing a clean interface for working with MongoDB.

# About

Get Feedback Now is an application that enables a business owner to get feedback about their product or service quickly.

## Campaigns

Users will be able to purchase credits that they can exchange for campaigns. A campaign is user-curated survey sent to a list of emails. The email will contain a link where recipients can provide feedback. This feedback will be organized under the campaign, allowing the user to see feedback instantaneously.

### Technology

The front end makes use of React and Redux, and the backend uses MongoDB, Google OAuth, and Stripe.

#### Git Workflow

Master -> Development -> new-feature

- new-feature: new feautures will be developed and tested in their own branch, and then will be merged into development.
- Development: development will incorporate new features, where they will be tried and tested before being merged into the master branch.
- Master: The master branch will only contain production ready code and will be pushed to production intermittently.
